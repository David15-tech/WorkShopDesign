A physics analysis usually encompasses running over hundreds of gigabytes of data. At CMS, this is usually performed using high-throughput batch systems such as the HTCondor installation at CERN and at other research institutions as well as the worldwide LHC computing grid (WLCG). Not everyone will have these resources available at their own institution, but nowadays anyone can get access to computing resources via public cloud vendors. This lesson will give you a first taste of running realistic physics analyses “in the cloud” using Kubernetes (as well as giving you a brief introduction to Kubernetes itself).
